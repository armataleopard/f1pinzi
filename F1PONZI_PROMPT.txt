PROJECT: F1PONZI ($ZOOOM)

CONCEPT:
F1PONZI ($ZOOOM) is a meme coin project inspired by the high-octane world of Formula 1 racing, mixed with Ponzi-style satirical humor and a touch of crypto chaos. The website should evoke a futuristic, neon-lit atmosphere, similar to a blend of Tron, cyberpunk racing, and F1 aesthetics. The style should be *very digital*, sleek, and saturated with motion and light effects.

DESIGN STYLE:
- **Theme**: Futuristic neon / Synthwave / Cyber-racing
- **Colors**: Neon pink, blue, purple, black background
- **Typography**: Digital/glow font with strong presence
- **Layout**: Wide-screen, parallax scroll, smooth animated transitions
- **Animation**: Spark trails, LED flickers, data stream backgrounds, car drift effects, NFT flips, UI blinkers

PAGE STRUCTURE:
1. **Banner Section**
   - Background: F1 race scene with racing lights and coin symbols flying by
   - Logo (logo.jpg) centered with glow
   - Title: "F1PONZI ($ZOOOM)" in large neon letters, pulsing animation
   - CTA Buttons: "Twitter", "Pump.fun" with glowing borders

2. **Intro Story**

     - Displayed with fade-in typing animation
   - Background: Racing chart candles and crypto line graphs in motion

3. **The Garage**
   - Show off the characters: frogs in racing suits, pit crew of clowns
   - Cards for each "driver" with hover animations
   - Small NFT-style memes flip on hover

4. **Tokenomics**

   - Visual stats with animated dollar signs flying around

5. **Roadmap**
   - Neon-style timeline from “Pit Stop” to “Lambo Launch”
